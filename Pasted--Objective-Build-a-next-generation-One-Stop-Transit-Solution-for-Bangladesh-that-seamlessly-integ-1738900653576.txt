Design & Development Workflow

Ideation & Research:
Gather requirements from user interviews, transit operators, and stakeholders.
Create a user flow diagram (e.g., using Figma or paper sketches) covering onboarding, ride booking, live tracking, payment, and transit card management.
Wireframing & Prototyping (Using Figma):
Create low-fidelity wireframes for key screens (Onboarding, Home, Route Planner, Booking, Payment, Transit Card, Profile).
Develop a design system with a consistent color palette, typography, and UI components.
Build high-fidelity interactive prototypes with smooth transitions and animations.
Development:
Set up a development environment and use a framework like React (with tools such as GitHub Copilot for code generation).
Integrate third-party APIs (Google Maps, Railway API, Payment Gateways).
Implement backend services for real-time tracking, user management, and data analytics.
Testing & Feedback:
Conduct user testing sessions to gather feedback on UI/UX and functionality.
Use automated testing tools to ensure performance across devices.
Iterate based on feedback.
Launch & Scale:
Begin with a pilot in select corridors, then expand to cover all major transport modes.
Monitor performance, refine features, and scale the solution across Bangladesh.
Implement monetization strategies such as transaction fees, subscriptions, and in-app advertising.
